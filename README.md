ENG5325 - Robotics Team Design Project (Robot Soccer Simulation)

The Robo-Cup Soccer Kid Size competition is an international initiative to promote robotics and artificial intelligence research through soccer games played by autonomous robots. In this project, we developed a 2D simulation like the competition using MATLAB and Simulink. The simulation consists of eight humanoid robots, with four in each team. Each team has four different roles: Striker, Mid, Defender, and Goalkeeper.  
The robots in the simulation exhibit different behaviours based on their roles within the team. For example, the Strikers are responsible for attacking the opponent's goal and scoring points, while the Defenders focus on defending their own goal and preventing the opponents from scoring. The Goalkeeper, as the name suggests, is responsible for protecting the goal and preventing the ball from entering.  
The simulation follows the rules and guidelines of the Robo-Cup Soccer Kid Size competition, including the dimensions of the playing field, the size of the ball, and the duration of the game. The simulation provides a testbed for evaluating and improving the performance of the robots, allowing researchers to experiment with different strategies and algorithms in a controlled environment.
